# Kickstarter Projects Analyzer

This code analyzes distinct Kickstarter projects using a [Kaggle case](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects), with machine learning, learned at APC in UAB.


## Local application

The code provides a local application that allows the user to predict the success of a Kickstarter project. The application is written in Python 3.11.6, and can be executed by running the following commands in the terminal:

#### MacOS/Linux:

```
cd app
python3 main.py
```

#### Windows:

```
cd app
python main.py
```


## How is the analysis organized?

The analysis is organized in 5 parts:
* **Data analysis**: This part is focused on the analysis of the data, and the selection of the most relevant features.
* **Preprocessing**: This part is focused on the preprocessing of the data, in order to make it suitable for the machine learning algorithms.
* **Metric selection**: This part is focused on the selection of the most suitable metric for the problem.
* **Random Forest**: This part is focused on the training of a Random Forest model, and the evaluation of its performance.


## How to run the code?

The code is written in Python 3.11.6, and it is contained in the file `analysis.py` and `src/` folder. To run the code, you need to execute the following commands in the terminal:

#### MacOS/Linux:

```
cd src
python3 main.py
```

#### Windows:

```
cd src
python main.py
```
