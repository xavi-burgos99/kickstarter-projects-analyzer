# Kickstarter Projects Analyzer

This code analyzes distinct Kickstarter projects using a [Kaggle case](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects), with machine learning, learned at APC in UAB.


## How is the analysis organized?

The analysis is organized in 5 parts:
* **Data analysis**: This part is focused on the analysis of the data, and the selection of the most relevant features.
* **Preprocessing**: This part is focused on the preprocessing of the data, in order to make it suitable for the machine learning algorithms.
* **Machine learning**: This part is focused on the selection of the machine learning algorithms, and the evaluation of them.
    * **Metrics**: This part is focused on the selection of the metrics that will be used to evaluate the machine learning algorithms.
	* **Algorithms**: This part is focused on the selection of the machine learning algorithms.
	* **Evaluation**: This part is focused on the evaluation of the machine learning algorithms.
	* **Hyperparameter tuning**: This part is focused on the hyperparameter tuning of the machine learning algorithms.
	* **Cross validation**: This part is focused on the cross validation of the machine learning algorithms.
	* **Final evaluation**: This part is focused on the final evaluation of the machine learning algorithms.
* **Final analysis**: This part is focused on the final analysis of the machine learning algorithms.


## How to run the code?

The code is written in Python 3.7.3, and it is contained in the file `analysis.py`. To run the code, you need to execute the following commands in the terminal:

#### MacOS/Linux:

```$ python3 analysis.py```

#### Windows:

```$ python analysis.py```
